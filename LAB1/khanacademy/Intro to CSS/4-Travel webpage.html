    <p id ="m">The Northern Tien-Shan Mountains are the most visitable in Kazakhstan because of the proximity of big city – Almaty. To the system of the Northern Tien-Shan mountain ranges belong: Trans-Ili Alatau, Kungey Alatau, Terskey Alatau and Ketmen (Uzynkara). The Trans-Ili Alatau Mountains surround Almaty in the south. As a result this part of the Northern Tien-Shan Mountains is the most accessible for tourism. You needn’t waste a lot of time to get from the center of the city to the start point of hiking path. It is just taking 1-1,5 hours.</p> <br>
    <li><strong><em>Hawaii ocean</em></strong></li>

    <p class = "ocean">While people-watching on the Hawaiian Islands is certainly interesting, it can’t compare to the excitement of spotting our colorful underwater residents. From yellow butterfly fish that dart among the rocks to benevolent green sea turtles, it’s easy to see these fascinating locals while snorkeling, scuba diving, or at an aquarium. Here are a few of the species of local marine life you might see during your visit. </p> <br>
    <li><strong><em>Niagara waterfall</em></strong></li>

    <p id = "falls">Niagara Falls (/naɪˈæɡərə/) is a group of three waterfalls at the southern end of Niagara Gorge, spanning the border between the province of Ontario in Canada and the state of New York in the United States. The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls, which straddles the international border of the two countries.[1] It is also known as the Canadian Falls.[2] The smaller American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie within the United States. Bridal Veil Falls is separated from Horseshoe Falls by Goat Island and from American Falls by Luna Island, with both islands situated in New York.</p>
