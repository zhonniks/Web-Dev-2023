        <p>The <em></em> is awesome because <strong></strong>.</p>
        <p><strong><em>A retriever is a type of gun dog that retrieves game for a hunter</em></strong> Generally gun dogs are divided into three major classifications: retrievers, flushing spaniels, and pointing breeds. Retrievers were bred primarily to retrieve birds or other prey and return them to the hunter without damage; retrievers are distinguished in that nonslip retrieval is their primary function. As a result, retriever breeds are bred for soft mouths and a great willingness to please, learn, and obey.
