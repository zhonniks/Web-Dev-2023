    I don't know how someone controlled you<br>
    They bought and sold you<br>
    I look at the world<br>
    And I notice, it's turning<br>
    While my guitar gently weeps<br>
    <strong>
    With every mistake<br> 
    We must surely be learning<br> 
    Still my guitar gently weeps<br>
    </strong>
    I don't know how you were diverted<br>
    You were perverted too<br>
    I don't know how you were inverted<br>
    No one alerted you
